## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `oadec-bits`: MSB-first bit reader with windowed peeking, the TrueHD
  CRC-8/CRC-16 polynomials and the parity helpers.
- `oadec-truehd`: access-unit framing and resynchronisation, major sync with
  the extra channel meaning, substream directory, extra data with Evolution
  containers, the complete substream syntax (restart header, block header,
  `0x31EA`/`0x31EB`/`0x31EC` matrices, FIR/IIR filters, Huffman and plain
  block data, segment terminator, parity and CRC), the sample decoder for
  presentations 0–3 with lossless checks, and the timing model with
  seamless-branch judgement and duplicate detection.
- `oadec-emdf`: EMDF/Evolution container parser and the Object Audio
  Metadata payload of ETSI TS 103 420 §5.5 (program assignment, object,
  trim and extended object elements; unknown elements skipped by size).
- `oadec-spatial`: program model and event timeline, DAMF writer
  (`.atmos`, `.atmos.metadata`, `.atmos.audio` as 24-bit CAF), ADM BWF
  writer (RIFF or RF64 with `axml`, `chna` and `dbmd` chunks).
- `oadec-eac3`: AC-3 and Enhanced AC-3 core decoder from ETSI TS 102 366
  (both syntaxes, coupling, rematrixing, spectral extension, the adaptive
  hybrid transform with vector and gain-adaptive quantization, delta bit
  allocation, block switching, dither), with the skip fields captured for
  EMDF. Enhanced coupling is parsed but not decoded; transient pre-noise
  processing is parsed but not applied.
- `oadec-joc`: the JOC side information (ETSI TS 103 420 clause 6), the
  64-band complex QMF bank (clause 7) and the object reconstruction, with
  the -j rotation of the surround pair for the phase-shifted downmix
  configurations.
- `oadec` command line: `info`, `verify [--json]`, `decode` to `pcm`,
  `wav`, `damf` or `adm` (TrueHD presentations and E-AC-3 JOC objects),
  `compare` against a raw PCM reference (24-bit integer for TrueHD, 32-bit
  float for E-AC-3), `oamd` and `emdf` payload dumps.
- `tools/three_way.py`: oadec against FFmpeg and a Dolby decode of the same
  stream; `tools/gen_joc_tables.py`, `tools/gen_vq_tables.py`: format
  tables from the specification files.
- `tools/adm_diff.py`: structural comparison of two ADM BWF files.
- Documentation: format notes (`docs/truehd.md`, `docs/oamd.md`,
  `docs/eac3.md`, `docs/joc.md`), the behaviour of the Dolby command-line
  tools (`docs/dolby-tools.md`) and the evidence reports under
  `docs/evidence/`.
