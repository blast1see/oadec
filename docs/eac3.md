# E-AC-3 format notes

Facts about AC-3 / Enhanced AC-3 (ETSI TS 102 366 V1.4.1) that the decoder
relies on and that took a measurement or a second reading to pin down.
Clause numbers refer to that document; "measured" means checked on the
streams listed in `docs/evidence/2026-09-08.md`.

- **Syntax detection.** `bsid` sits at bit 40 of every syncframe for both
  syntaxes (AC-3 after `syncword crc1 fscod frmsizecod`, E-AC-3 after
  `syncword strmtyp substreamid frmsiz fscod numblkscod acmod lfeon`).
  `bsid <= 8` is AC-3, `11..=16` is E-AC-3, 9 and 10 must not be decoded
  (clause E.1.3.1.6).
- **Reduced sample rates.** V1.4.1 reserves `fscod == 3`; earlier revisions
  put `fscod2` in the two bits that otherwise carry `numblkscod`, with six
  blocks per frame. The header parser keeps that reading.
- **Frame CRC.** `crc2` checks when the CRC-16 (`x^16 + x^15 + x^2 + 1`,
  register 0) over the frame without its sync word ends at zero; for AC-3
  the first 5/8 of the frame (`(words >> 1) + (words >> 3)` words) checks
  the same way for `crc1` (clause 6.10.1). Measured: 0 failures on 3.3
  million frames.
- **SNR offset.** `snroffset = (((csnroffst - 15) << 4) + fsnroffst) << 2`;
  the text of clause 6.2.2.1 leaves the precedence to the reader.
- **Default coupling band structure (E-AC-3).** Table E.1.12 is indexed by
  the absolute coupling sub-band number; the transmitted `cplbndstrc[bnd]`
  is relative to `cplbegf`. With `cplbegf = 11` the default gives 2 coupling
  bands out of 4 sub-bands. Copying the table by relative index desynchronised
  every frame of the stereo stream (measured, then fixed).
- **Dither.** Zero-bit mantissas take random values when `dithflag` is set;
  the sequence is the implementation's (clause 6.3.4). Two conforming
  decoders therefore never produce the same samples; they agree to 35–55 dB
  depending on the content, and to float precision where no bin is
  dithered. The dither of coupled bins is scaled by the coupling coordinate
  (up to 8x), which is where most of the residual of stereo streams lies.
- **Decoder delay.** The first 256 output samples are the first block's
  half window over silence. The Dolby decoder drops them; FFmpeg and oadec
  keep them. Object metadata counts time from the first frame's first
  sample, so the object output drops them too.
- **Block switching.** The pair of 256-sample transforms takes the even
  coefficients for the first half and the odd ones for the second, as
  clause 6.9.4.2 says; swapping them ruins every switched block (tried).
  Clause 6.9 is self-consistent: the forward transform of clause 7.2.3.2
  followed by the inverse reconstructs to 1e-9 in the unit tests.
- **Window.** The Kaiser-Bessel-derived window with alpha 5 computed in
  double precision matches the five-decimal table 6.33 within 6e-6.
- **AHT.** The inverse DCT of clause E.2.4.5 is `C(k,m) = sqrt(2) sum_j
  R_j X(k,j) cos(j(2m+1)pi/12)` with `R_0 = 1/sqrt(2)`; the text extraction
  of the PDF garbles it.
- **Gain-adaptive quantization.** The helper array of clause E.2.4.2 marks
  a bin as gain-coded from its `hebap` alone, but clause E.2.4.4.2 says
  `gaqmod == 0` transmits no gain words and uses the plain quantizer
  throughout. Reading a gain word for those bins reads the wrong bits (and
  crashed the decoder before the low-rate material was made).
- **Getting AHT and spectral extension to appear.** No film in the corpus
  used either. Encoding 5.1 material with DEE `pcm_to_ddp` at 384 kbit/s
  gives AHT in almost every frame, and at 192 kbit/s spectral extension in
  every frame as well; below 192 the encoder refuses 5.1. Measured in
  `docs/evidence/2026-09-09.md`.
- **Spectral extension noise** is drawn by the decoder, like the dither of
  clause 6.3.4, so decoders differ audibly less than the raw ratio
  suggests: on a stream with SPX in every frame two conforming decoders sit
  15-19 dB apart on the surround channels.
- **EMDF placement.** JOC streams carry one EMDF container per frame in the
  skip field of an audio block (clause H.1); parsing the skip fields is exact,
  scanning the frame bytes for `0x5838` is not (false syncs in audio data).
- **Coded channel order** is table 4.3 (`L C R Ls Rs`, LFE last); the WAVE
  and FFmpeg order is `L R C LFE Ls Rs`.
